# What is GlumSak?
This project originally was a joke and I never thought that I'll do this some day.
This project is highly inspired from emusak-ui  by CapitaineJSparrow. With the difference 
that I did all the things from ground up myself. This is probably my biggest and most 
time consuming project, but I really enjoy developing it. 

A special thanks to all the people in Sin's cove that motivated me over the past 1-2 weeks 
making this project happen.

And another special thanks to Sin himself for supporting me and this project
by buying me a server to test around with and for having such a cool community.
  
# What can it do?
  - Install keys, shaders and firmwares to yuzu (shader not supported currently) and ryu with only a few clicks!
  - To select a portable install open the settings with the button on the left and select the folder of the portable Yuzu/Ryujinx make sure you select the folder that contains the filesystem folders and files, for Ryu it would be called "portable" and for Yuzu it's "user" then restart the app 
  
# Future plans
  Soon!
  
# Current supported shaders
  - All as long as you use a valid shaders file
  
# What is it written in?
  - C# Winforms in .NET Framework 4.8.1
  - A little part is written in Python
  
  
# This is for education, use at your own risk!
